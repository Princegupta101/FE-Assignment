Card LIsting 

The Card Listing project is a web application that displays a list of cards with different types and filters. It allows users to view and filter cards based on ownership and card type.

Getting Started

To run the application on your end, follow the instructions below:

1.Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the source code as a ZIP file.

2.Open the downloaded project folder.

3.Open the index.html file in a web browser.

4.The Card Listing application will be displayed in the web browser.

Usage

The Card Listing application provides the following functionality:

1.Tab Buttons: There are three tab buttons at the top of the page: "Your," "All," and "Blocked." Clicking on these buttons filters the cards based on ownership. The "Your" tab shows cards owned by the user, the "All" tab shows all cards, and the "Blocked" tab shows blocked cards.


2.Card Type Filter: Below the tab buttons, there is a filter dropdown labeled "Card Type." This dropdown allows you to filter cards based on their type. The available options are "All," "Burner," and "Subscription." Selecting an option from the dropdown will filter the cards accordingly.

3.Card Listing: The main section of the page displays the list of cards. Each card represents a budget or subscription and contains information such as the card name, budget name, type, expiry (for burner cards), limit (for subscription cards), and status. The cards are dynamically rendered based on the selected filters.
